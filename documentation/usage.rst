
Usage
#####

This module can be used in one of two ways.

#. Import it, and make API calls. This is the simplest, and most basic way to use this module

#. Run it as a service, and use the REST API. Running it as a service has
   the advantage of having a system-wide configuration, and having a
   centrally cached and maintained data. It can also make more efficient use
   of operating system services to keep the data up-to-date. As susch, it
   would be a good choice for Explorer of File Manager extensions.
